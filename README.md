This Jupyter notebook contains a logistic regression analysis on a Pew Research Center 2014 science survey dataset. The goal of the analysis is to accurately predict responses to questions on scientific issues based on the demographic predictor variables such as age, income, and population density. The dataset is imported into pandas and cleaned. A grid search over parameters of a Logistic Regression model is performed for each question of interest. The model scores 50-80% for all questions.
